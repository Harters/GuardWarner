Use this addon to spot invulnerable guards at a distance when moused over.

This addon can be made to warn when the player's reticule moves onto an
invulnerable guard. The addon's settings can be configured to show a red shield
just above the player reticule when the player has a bounty, or a yellow shield
regardless of bounty. The addon can play an optional sound cue along with either
of these optional events.

As of version 1.2 the remaining bounty time, until the player becomes
upstanding, can be displayed above the shield.
